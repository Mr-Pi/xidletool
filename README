xidletool is a program that reads a user's idle time from the X server.
It either prints the idle time to stdout or allows you to set a target
idle time. If the target is reached, the program exits.

Building a release:

./configure
make
make install

Building from git: 

autoreconf
automake -c --add-missing
autoreconf
./configure
make
make install

You need the development files for the Xss library.
